# wyman-twitter-server
simple twitter account checker

## description
wyman is a simple python server designed to periodically check twitter accounts and send new posts by the account to a webhook. wyman's jobs are controlled by `.wyman` files: JSON files that lay out the configuration for what account to check, how often to check, what webhook to send content to, and what to send.

## instructions
1. rename `empty_config.json` to `config.json`
2. fill in your twitter api credentials at `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`
3. fill in `job_interval` with the interval of seconds to check for new jobs
4. create any jobs you'd like wyman to perform in the `jobs` folder
5. start `app.py`!

## examples
